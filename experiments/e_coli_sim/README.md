# `e_coli_sim`
The script `get_datasets.sh` assumes that you have NCBI's [`dataset`](https://github.com/ncbi/datasets) and [`iqtree3`](https://iqtree.github.io/) installed and visible by your `PATH` environment variable (modify `get_datasets.sh` accordingly if you get the programs some other way).
```
./get_datasets.sh
./run_experiment.sh
```
